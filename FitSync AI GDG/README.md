Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project Title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.

# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mx2v0pEt_A>
#### Description:

If unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax helpful. You can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here: Markdown Preview in vscode. Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail!

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! A README.md in the neighborhood of 750 words is likely to be sufficient for describing your project and all aspects of its functionality. If unable to reach that threshold, that probably means your project is insufficiently complex.

Execute the submit50 command below from within your project directory (or from whichever directory contains README.md file and your project’s code, which must also be submitted), logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you’ll see asterisks instead of the actual characters in your password.

Trouble Submitting?
If you encounter issues because your project is too large, try to ZIP all of the contents of that directory (except for README.md) and then submit that instead. If still too large, try removing certain configuration files, reducing the size of your submission below 100MB, or try to upload directly using GitHub’s web interface by visiting github.com/me50/USERNAME (where USERNAME is your own GitHub username) and manually dragging and dropping folders, ensuring that when uploading you are doing so to your cs50/problems/2024/x/project branch, otherwise the system will not be able to check it!
